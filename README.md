### Hello there! :) ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marcos and I'm a Brazilian Engineer that loves to explore and model data. I intent to keep this GitHub page as my portfolio where I'll be sharing some projects that I find interesting and showcasing my current knowledge and skillset. Feedbacks are always welcome and hope you enjoy!

### My Data Science Path So Far

I've been interacting and constantly studying Python, SQL and other data tools for about 2 years now. The projects that I keep here simulate real business problems and trying to solve them is my main objective. 

### Tools That I Use

* Data Collecting and Storage: SQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL.
* Data Processing and Analysis: Python
* Development: CRiSP-DM, Git, Linux.
