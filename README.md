### Greetings ma friends! ğŸ‘‹


My name is Marcos and I'm a 28 year old engineer trailing the Data Science journey. I intent to keep this GitHub page as my portfolio where I'll be sharing some projects that I find interesting. On my off time you will find me playing basketball and grinding some 1v1s in Age of Empires II DE. 

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and ML
