### Greetings ma friends! ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**mvrcosp/mvrcosp** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Marcos and I'm a 28 year old engineer trailing the Data Science journey. I intent to keep this GitHub page as my portfolio where I'll be sharing some projects that I find interesting. On my off time you will find me playing basketball and grinding some 1v1s in Age of Empires II DE. 

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and ML
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about the NBA!
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: marcosffpoleto@gmail.com
