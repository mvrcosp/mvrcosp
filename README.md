### Greetings ma friends! 👋


My name is Marcos and I'm a Brazilian engineer trailing the Data Science journey. I intent to keep this GitHub page as my portfolio where I'll be sharing some projects that I find interesting. On my off time you will find me playing basketball and grinding some 1v1s in Age of Empires II DE. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and ML
- 💬 Ask me about anything, if I don't know the answer I'll help you find it :)
- 📫 How to reach me: marcosffpoleto@gmail.com
